# Planing Tool for Decidim


## Mermaid â†’ Survey

This repo automatically generates an interactive form from a Mermaid diagram file (`form-definition.mmd`) and publishes the result with GitHub Pages.

## This is how it works

- Make changes to `form-definition.mmd` (example: an answer tree).
- Run `npm run build` or push to GitHub - a GitHub Action will automatically build the form.
- The result is published on `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>`.
